This is the set of items we plan to verify before switching BridgePF from heroku to AWS.

1. Run BridgePF integration tests against aws bridgepf-prod environment and verify results are as expected.
Tests: https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/BridgeIntegrationTests
Expected result: all tests should pass

2. Run tests to verify that aws alarms are triggering and sending notifications to bridgeops@sagebridge.org.
Running the BridgePF integration tests will probably verify a few of the alarms as well.
Tests: https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/BridgePF-infra/tree/develop/test/alarms
Expected result: notifications is sent to bridgeops@sagebridge.org

3. Run a load test against BridgePF that will trigger aws autoscaling to scale up and down EC2 instances.

Will test the default autoscale trigger that is setup by EB:

Threshold:The condition in which the alarm will go to the ALARM state.NetworkOut > 6,000,000 for 5 minutes
Actions:The actions that will occur when the alarm changes state.
In ALARM:
  For group awseb-e-693tmvruhq-stack-AWSEBAutoScalingGroup-ZUQRSM8OL33O use policy
  awseb-e-693tmvruhq-stack-AWSEBAutoScalingScaleUpPolicy-10KCDPLCFOMVK (Add 1 instance)


Test: Create a new tests to generate network load, 6000K requests within 5 minutes
Expected result: AWS spins up a new EC2 instance

Test: stop load test
Expected result: AWS removes an EC2 instance


4. Configure new relic to send alerts to bridgeops@sagebridge.org and verify that alerts are being sent out.
Test: create a simple alert on new relic and trigger it.
Expected result: notification is sent to bridgeops@sagebridge.org
